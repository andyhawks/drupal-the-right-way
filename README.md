# Drupal: The Right Way

## Overview

This is a guide to Drupal development best practices inspired by [PHP: The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/). The project is in its infancy. If it's successful, it may evolve into something more sophisticated, but to get things started, it is structured as a set of best practice checklists (ht [cc2e.com](http://www.cc2e.com/)) arranged by topic in individual Markdown files.
